# repair-hangman-game
I debugged an existing game and added some features during Colt Steeles React Course.


# Added Features 

* Added a key to the buttons
* Added an counter of wrong guesses
* Added an game ending condition 
* Added an alt attribute to the hangman image that explains how many guesses have been made
* Added a function which picks random words at the start of the game instead of just one static word
* Added a "Restart" button

# What i learned

* How to read from other peoples codebase and debug it step by step
* Complement the code of other people by adding more functionality and features
